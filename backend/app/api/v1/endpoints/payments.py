"""
Objective: Implement payment processing endpoints.
This file defines the API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing
payments, including integration with a payment gateway (Stripe) and
background processing for payment-related operations.

This file implements a sophisticated payment processing API with payment gateway integration:

Purpose: Provides a complete interface for payment management, including creation, retrieval, refunds, and webhook handling for payment processing events.
Key Endpoints:

GET /: List payments with complex role-based filtering
POST /: Create new payments and initialize payment intents
GET /{id}: Get payment details with enrollment information
POST /{id}/refund: Process refunds for payments
POST /{id}/intent: Create payment intents for client-side checkout
POST /webhook: Handle payment gateway webhook events
GET /stats: Get payment statistics (admin only)


Design Patterns:

Role-based Access Control: Different data visibility and operations for students, instructors, and admins
Background Processing: Uses FastAPI's background tasks for async operations
Event-driven Architecture: Webhooks for payment status updates with notifications
Integration Pattern: Cleanly integrates with Stripe payment gateway
Repository Pattern: Uses specialized repository methods for complex queries


Security Features:

Authentication for all endpoints
Authorization checks for each operation with role-specific rules
Data isolation between users
Secure payment processing flow


Notable Implementation Details:

Background task processing for payment intents and notifications
Webhook handling for payment gateway events
Complex, role-based filtering and access control
Comprehensive error handling
Integration with notification service for payment events


Improvement Notes:

There's a missing import for course_service which is used in the code
The manual in-memory filtering and pagination in the read_payments endpoint could be optimized for larger datasets
Currency is hardcoded as "usd" but could be made configurable



This API demonstrates a professional approach to payment processing with proper separation of concerns, background processing, event handling through webhooks, and comprehensive notification upon payment events, providing a complete solution for handling financial transactions in the application.
